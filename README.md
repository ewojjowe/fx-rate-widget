Clone the repository, navigate to `fx-rate-widget` folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
Run `npm run start` or `ng serve --open` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ and test base on the acceptance criteria posted above.

## Running Unit Tests:  <a name = "run_unit_test"></a>

**Note before testing**

*Please update first the **expectedData** on the `fx-rates.service.specs.ts` as it will be outdated during testing.
The `exchangeratesapi` returned data contains date and timestamp on it which cause it to be outdated. You can get the latest
data by clicking this link [here](http://api.exchangeratesapi.io/v1/latest?access_key=f1fd1f5ce0b895913a96900d70805630&symbols=USD&format=1)*

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running E2E Tests: <a name = "run_e2e_test"></a>

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
